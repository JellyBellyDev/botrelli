BOTrelli
========

### The name

The Name is a tribute to a great FOSS developer, that helps the community daily,
but this BOT is just a stupid bot, is far from his quality.

### Why?

Because is hot today in Rome and we are going to meet into an hack-night.

### Troll or Bot?

I think that is a funny way to spent time together, so yes both.
